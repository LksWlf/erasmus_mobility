# Erasmus+ Mobility Program

## Introduction and Problem Description
Erasmus+ is a program of the European Union to promote cooperation between educational institutions and the mobility of individuals in the field of education within the EU and beyond. There is the possibility of study visits, internships for students and trainees, teaching and training activities. As a student myself, I was lucky enough to be able to participate in the Erasmus program in the past and visit a university in Portugal as part of my studies. Through my own positive experiences and numerous memories, I am a big fan of the program, which I am convinced promotes social cohesion within the EU.

In this Exploratory Data Analysis Project, we will use **Python** to answer some questions like:
1. What information do we have about age and gender of the participations?
2. How many participants of the program join the different fields like Higher Education and School Education?
3. How does a correlation matrix between sending and receiving countries look like? 

## Dataset
The Erasmus Mobility Dataset is provided by the European Union: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/erasmus-mobility-raw-data?locale=en.

## Method
After loading the data from the Excel file downloaded from the EU, we start by **understanding our dataset** and **checking for missing values as well as outliers** using **Pandas**. We particulary focus on the age values here, as the age of the participants is something we want to have a deeper look at. 
To understand our data more easily and quicker, we use **Seaborn** to create plots about different participants metrics.

## Result
The Exploratory Data Analysis provides a view and solid understanding about participants data of the Erasmus+ Program by the European Union. Following the number of participants and their characteristics can help the EU to sharpen the program and keep the interest for people to participate.
